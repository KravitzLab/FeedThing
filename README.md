# wifiFED (UNDER DEVELOPMENT) 
This is a development page for introducing wifi functionality to FED (https://github.com/KravitzLab/FED). The wifi functionality is currently still under development, but feel free to poke around.

The wifi FED uses a Sparkfun Thing, Adafruit v2 motor board, servo motor, and IR beam detector to log food taken to a phant server on WiFi. FeedThing runs off of a battery that provides ~10 days of use. 

We migrated FED from the Arduino Pro used in our SD-card version (https://github.com/KravitzLab/FED) to the Sparkfun Thing to take advantage of its built-in WIFI functionality and low power consumption.

The hardware directory contains the system schematics. 
The software is in FeedThingSketch.
