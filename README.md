# FeedThing
Food experimentation device for precision feeding of mice. The system uses a Sparkfun Thing, 
Adafruit v2 motor board, servo motor, and IR beam detector to log food taken to a phant server on WiFi. 
FeedThing runs off of a battery. 

Please see the wiki page for more information, including build instructions: [FIXME!]

The hardware directory contains the system schematics. 
The software is in FeedThingSketch.
