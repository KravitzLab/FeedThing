// Phant Keys //

// This is where you store your Phant Keys. They should be
// private to your project, not shared with others. 

// To learn about phant and how to set up your own keys
// (even your own, private phant server) go to 
// https://data.sparkfun.com/

// If your PublicKey or PrivateKey says "put key here", and
// this is a shared project, ask a team member for a copy.
// If this is your project, create a new datastream (at 
// the above site) and put the keys here.
